# Background
Identifying COVID-19 hospitalisations is crucial to the ongoing monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 hospitalisations can be identified from Admitted Patient Care Spells (APCS), which is part of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and is provided to OpenSAFELY via NHS Digital's Secondary Use Service (SUS).
However, patients are only included in the APCS dataset if they have been discharged by the data extraction date.
This means that patients who are currently in hospital will not appear in the extract, and therefore creates a delay in the availability of COVID-19 hospitalisations data.

Some patients are admitted to hospital with COVID-19 via accident and emergency (A&E).
COVID-19 hospitalisations that occur via A&E can be identified in the Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS).
The delay between the true event and the event being captured in the dataset is much shorter for ECDS compared to APCS.
Therefore, the use of ECDS may facilitate more up-to-date monitoring of COVID-19 hospitalisations.

# Objective
We have previously estimated waning effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines over six months since second dose.
In this previous study, we derving COVID-19 hospitalisation using APCS data.
The objective of this report was to extend this study by estimating vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalisation derived from the ECDS, and to compare the estimates with those derivde from APCS data.

# Methods
The methods used in the previous study are detailed here.
For the `r scales::comma(4734980+2433990, accuracy=1)` individuals who were eligible for inclusion in comparison period 1 of the previous study, we identified all A&E attendances with SNOMED codes indicating a COVID-19 diagnosis and discharge to hospital.
We retained only the earliest such attendance for each individual.
If the date of the earliest attendance occurred before the start of comparison period 1, the individual was excluded from the analysis.
Otherwise the earliest attendance was treated as the outcome of interest, as described in the statistical analysis section of the previous study.
