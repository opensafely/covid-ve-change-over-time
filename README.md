# Waning effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines over six months since second dose: a cohort study using linked electronic health records

The aim of this study was to comapre rates of COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 mortality, and infection with SARS-CoV-2, between adults fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) and the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 (ChAdOx1), and those who were unvaccinated.

* The [protocol is in the OpenSAFELY Google drive]()
* The pre-print is [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.23.22272804v1)
* Analysis scripts are in the [`analysis/`](./analysis) directory (see below for details)
* Non-disclosive model outputs, including tables, figures, etc, are in `released_outputs/`
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/)

### project.yaml
The [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml) defines run-order and dependencies for all the analysis scripts. 
**This file should *not* be edited directly**. To make changes to the yaml, edit and run the [`create-project.R`](./create-project.R) script instead.
The [`create-project.R`](./create-project.R) also creates metadata files and stores them in the [`analysis/lib`](./analysis/lib) folder.
These metadata files are annotated in [`create-project.R`](./create-project.R).
There is no need to run [`create_project.yaml`](./create_project.R) if you are simply cloning this repo.

Below is a description of each of the actions in the [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml):

#### `dummy_data_vax`
Runs [`dummy_data_vax.R`](analysis/dummy_data_vax.R) to generate dummy data. 
This is used instead of the usual dummy data specified in [`study_definition_vax.py`](analysis/study_definition_vax.py), because it is then possible to impose some more useful structure in the data, such as ensuring nobody has a first dose of both the Pfizer and Astra-Zeneca vaccines. 
If [`study_definition_vax.py`](analysis/study_definition_vax.py) is updated, [`dummy_data_vax.R`](analysis/dummy_data_vax.R) must also be updated to ensure variable names and types match.

#### `generate_study_population`
Runs [`study_definition_vax.py`](analysis/study_definition_vax.py) to define the JCVI groups (see [`grouping_variables.py`](analysis/grouping_variables.py)), the vaccine vairables, the vairables used to apply the initial eligibility criteria, and the outcome variables (with the exception of anytest which is defined in [`study_definition_covs.py`](analysis/study_definition_covs.py)).

#### `data_input_process`
Runs [`data_input_process.R`](analysis/preprocess/data_input_process.R) to process `input_vax.feather` (generated by `generate_study_population`).

#### `data_eligible_ab`
Runs [`data_eligible_ab.R`](analysis/preprocess/data_eligible_ab.R) to apply eligibility criteria from boxes A and B in Figure 3 of the protocol.

#### `data_2nd_vax_dates`
Runs [`data_2nd_vax_dates.R`](analysis/second_vax_period/data_2nd_vax_dates.R) to identify the 28-day period in each strata during which the greatest number of second vaccine doses were received.

#### `plot_2nd_vax_dates`
Runs [`plot_2nd_vax_dates.R`](analysis/second_vax_period/plot_2nd_vax_dates.R) to plot the distribution of second vaccination period (SVP) dates in each stratum.

#### `data_eligible_cde`
Runs [`data_eligible_cde.R`](analysis/preprocess/data_eligible_cde.R) to apply eligibility criteria from boxes C, D and E in Figure 3 of the protocol.

#### `generate_covs_data`
Runs [`study_definition_covs.py`](analysis/study_definition_covs.py) to define covariates for the Cox model, which are defined at the start of the SVP.

#### `data_covariates_process`
Runs [`data_covariates_process.R`](analysis/preprocess/data_covariates_process.R) to process `input_covs.feather` (generated by `generate_covs_data`).

#### `data_min_max_fu`
Runs [`data_min_max_fu.R`](analysis/comparisons/data_min_max_fu.R) which creates a csv file containing the earliest and latest follow-up dates in each subgroup.
This csv file is released as it is used when plotting the results of the Cox models.

#### `plot_cumulative_incidence`
Runs [`plot_cumulative_incidence.R`](analysis/subsequent_vax/plot_cumulative_incidence.R) 


### `analysis/`

* The following files outline how we defined our variables:
  * [`study_definition_vax.py`](analysis/study_definition_vax.py) defines the JCVI groups (see [`grouping_variables.py`](analysis/grouping_variables.py)), the vaccine vairables, and the vairables used to apply the initial eligibility criteria
  * [`study_definition_ever.py`](analysis/study_definition_ever.py) defines the covairates for the model that are either based on an "ever" diagnosis, or are not updated at the start of each comparison period
  * [`study_definition_k.py`](analysis/study_definition_k.py) is the template for definining covariates at the start of comparison *k*; see the [`create-project.R`](./create-project.R) script for how to create a script for each comparison period from this template
* [`dummy_data_vax.R`](analysis/dummy_data_vax.R) contains the script used to generate dummy data. This is used instead of the usual dummy data specified in [`study_definition_vax.py`](analysis/study_definition_vax.py), because it is then possible to impose some more useful structure in the data, such as ensuring nobody has a first dose of both the Pfizer and Astra-Zeneca vaccines. If [`study_definition_vax.py`](analysis/study_definition_vax.py) is updated, this script must also be updated to ensure variable names and types match.
* [`lib/`](./analysis/lib)
  * [`data_process_functions.R`](analysis/lib/data_process_functions.R) contains functions used in data processing
  * [`dummy_data_functions.R`](analysis/lib/dummy_data_functions.R) contains functions used to define the dummy data
  * [`data_properties.R`](analysis/lib/data_properties.R) contains functions to summarise data properties
  * [`redaction_functions.R`](analysis/lib/redaction_functions.R) contains functions for redacting values <= a specified threshold
  * [`round_km.R`](analysis/lib/round_km.R) contains functions for rounding Kaplan-Meier estimates for disclosure control
* The scripts in [`preprocess/`](.analysis/preprocess), [`second_vax_period/`](./analysis/second_vax_period), [`subsequent_vax/`](./analysis/subsequent_vax), [`comparisons/`](./analysis/comparisons), and [`report/`](./analysis/report) carry out preprocessing, analysis and postprocessing, and are applied in the [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml)
* [`post_release/`](./analysis/post_release) contains scripts that apply postprocessing to the released results:
  * [`flow.R`](analysis/post_release/flow.R) creates a table of the flow of individuals into the study
  * [`table1_process.Rmd`](analysis/post_release/table1_process.Rmd) creates Table 1 for the manuscript, which can be rendered by running [`render_tables.R`](analysis/post_release/render_tables.R)
  * [`data_metareg_process.R`](analysis/post_release/data_metareg_process.R) prepares the data for metaregression
  * [`waning_metareg.do`](analysis/post_release/waning_metareg.do) applies the metaregression
  * [`data_metareg_k.R`](analysis/post_release/data_metareg_k.R) applies some postprocessing to the metaregression results
  * [`plot_cox_all.R`](analysis/post_release/plot_cox_all.R) plots the results of the Cox regression and metaregression

### `manuscript/`

* [`manuscript_text.Rmd`](manuscript/manuscript_text.Rmd) contains some paragraphs from the manuscript that have a lot of references to the effect estimates **note that this script needs updating with updated wording**
* [`appendix.Rmd`](manuscript/appendix.Rmd) contains the supplementary material for the paper; to render to a PDF requires [`preamble.tex`](manuscript/preamble.tex) and [`preface.tex`](manuscript/preface.tex)
